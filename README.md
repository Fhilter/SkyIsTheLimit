# SkyIsTheLimit

A simple space related web app, using only html, css, and scripts.

This was a basic project, at the start of my training, but it was extrememly basic! I've since added new content for fun and worked to embed other items and sites, as well as do API fetches.

My next goal is to add some animation to the site, in order to practice css. For further dynamicism I will be using React in upcoming projects.

Currently only tested on a desktop browser, dynamic styling and adjustments will need to be made.
