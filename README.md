# SkyIsTheLimit

A simple space related web app, using only html, css, and vanilla JS.

This was a basic project, at the start of my training, but it was extrememly basic: a static header image and 3 galaxies. I've since added new content for fun and worked to embed other items and sites, as well as do API fetches from Nasa for random images of the cosmos.

My next goal is to add some animation to the site, in order to practice css. For further functionality I will be using React in upcoming projects, however this "old school" method was fun.

Currently only tested on a desktop browser, adjustments to incorporate responsive design will be made next.
